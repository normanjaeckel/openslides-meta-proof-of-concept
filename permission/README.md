# Proposals

Maybe we can code everything in Python using
https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html to parse or dump the code as abstract
syntax tree and then use parsers for the other languages that are required.

Maybe we can code everything in Go using https://pkg.go.dev/go/ast and
https://pkg.go.dev/go/parser the same way.
